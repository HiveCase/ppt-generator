## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### How Text is Parsed and Mapped:
The application uses a sophisticated LLM-based approach:
1. Text is sent to the LLM with structured prompts
2. LLM analyzes content density, topics, and logical flow
3. Returns JSON with slide structure, titles, and content
4. App maps this to PowerPoint elements using PptxGenJS

### Template Style Application:
When a template is uploaded:
1. File is read client-side using FileReader API
2. Style elements are extracted (colors, fonts, layouts)
3. These styles are applied to generated slides
4. Images from template can be reused in appropriate contexts

### Technologies Used:
- React 18 for UI
- PptxGenJS for PowerPoint generation
- Marked.js for Markdown parsing
- JSZip for file operations
- Modern browser APIs for file handling

## üìù Examples

### Example Input:
```markdown
# Quarterly Business Review

## Executive Summary
Revenue increased 25% YoY
Customer satisfaction at all-time high
Three new products launched successfully

## Financial Performance
- Q3 Revenue: $2.5M
- Gross Margin: 68%
- Customer Acquisition Cost: $1,200
```

### Generated Output:
- Slide 1: Title slide with "Quarterly Business Review"
- Slide 2: Executive Summary with key points
- Slide 3: Financial Performance with metrics
- Slide 4: Thank you/Questions slide

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

- Template style extraction is simplified (full template parsing requires complex OOXML processing)
- Large text inputs (>10,000 words) may hit API token limits
- Generated presentations use standard layouts (custom layouts from templates not fully supported)
- Image extraction from templates not implemented in current version

## üöß Roadmap

- [ ] Enhanced template parsing with full style extraction
- [ ] Support for images in templates
- [ ] Batch processing for multiple presentations
- [ ] Save/load presentation drafts
- [ ] More layout options and transitions
- [ ] Export to Google Slides format
- [ ] Support for charts and graphs
- [ ] Collaborative editing features

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Is my API key safe?**
A: Yes, API keys are only used client-side and sent directly to the LLM provider. They're never stored or logged.

**Q: Can I use this offline?**
A: The app interface works offline, but generating presentations requires an internet connection for API calls.

**Q: What's the maximum text length?**
A: This depends on your LLM provider's token limits. Generally, 5,000-10,000 words work well.

**Q: Can I customize the slide designs?**
A: Yes, by uploading a template file. The app will attempt to match its styling.

**Q: Which LLM provider is best?**
A: All work well. OpenAI GPT-4 and Anthropic Claude tend to produce the most nuanced structures.
